    "Colombia has a 11.5 million bags of coffee as average production by year, the third largest exporter in the planet (1. Brazil, 2. Vietnam) and one of the most visited destination for coffee lovers. The diversity of his geographical conditions is ideal for growing a large variety of beans. The coffee industry in Medellín has become more modern and more coffee specialists and independents cafes have appeared in the Medellín Coffee scene, sharing that scene with the traditional **\"tinto\"**, it is not the best coffee, but is a big part of coffee culture in Medellín.\n",

This report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a **Cofee shop** or **Café** in **Medellín**, Colombia. We will try to detect where is located the most quantity of venues related with coffee, coffee shops, coffee pets or \"cafés\". We will find the distribution of cafes throughout the Medellín city both, by borough and by neighbourhood.\n",
